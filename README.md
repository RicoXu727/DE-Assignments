## Instructions

### How to Run the Game
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. 
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you have saved `main.py` and `functions.py`.
4. Run the command `python main.py` or `python3 main.py` (depending on your Python installation).
5. The game will start in the terminal window.

### How to Play
- After starting the game, you will see a 4x4 grid with two '2' tiles.
- Use the following keys to make moves:
  - `W` or `w` to move tiles up.
  - `S` or `s` to move tiles down.
  - `A` or `a` to move tiles left.
  - `D` or `d` to move tiles right.
  - `Q` or `q` to quit the game.
- After each move, a new '2' tile will appear in a random empty spot.
- Merge tiles of the same number to reach 2048.
- The game ends when you reach 2048 or when there are no more moves left.

## Enjoy the Game!
